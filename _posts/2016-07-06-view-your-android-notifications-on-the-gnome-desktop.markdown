The year gone by has seen an upsurge in applications that attempt to bridge the gap between your phone and your desktop. Some of them, like the ubiquitous Pushbullet, have already succeeded in providing a stable experience while maintaining a steady flow of updates that continue to improve on functionality. It must be stressed that these applications are usually cross-platform, only because they are browser based.While beta (read unstable) clients for Windows and Mac do exist, there is no mention of any plans to release a Linux client in the near future.

But what if there was an application that could offer this integration with the operating system's notification center, using only native notifications?

No more peeking at your phone every time a notificaton goes off!

Enter 'Nuntius', an application that attempts to tie in with the brilliant changes that the GNOME team have integrated into version 3.16 to provide native notifications on the GNOME Desktop.Read more... The app works on your phone, reading notifications as they pop up on your Android phone's drawer and passing them on to your GNOME Notification Center.

The developers have ensured the app will run on Bluetooth, which means that your data will never be sent via an external server. However, the developers have yet to integrate actionable notifications like the ones used on Pushbullet, to reply to a text message or archive an e-mail.

This is where Pushbullet has a clear advantage over Nuntius. The ability to dismiss a notification, respond to it or just postpone it makes Pushbullet a much better choice if you're a Windows user. However, it must be noted that Nuntius is a very new app and will (obviously) pick up a few tricks along the way.

You can grab Nuntius at GitHub (or find it in the official Fedora repositories), then install the app on your phone and have your own notifier up and running in minutes.
